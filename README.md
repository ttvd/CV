Education
---------

- **[Master of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/future-students/graduate/), [Carleton University](http://www.carleton.ca/), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, 2011.**

    11 / 12 GPA.

    My thesis project was a collaboration between bioinformatics and computer science departments. I wrote a modular cell simulation framework (using C++ and Qt framework), which allowed students to create their own plugins in order to simulate biological cells at required level of granularity. An example plugin based on full 3D physics simulation (rigid body simulation using NVidia PhysX physics library) was also created.
